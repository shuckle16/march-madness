## March Madness Prediction

Using a model built from historical, season level stats to help me fill out my bracket for the 2019 tournament. 

## About the Code

- The first 3 scripts import the relevant datasets (see below).

- The fourth script joins the season aggregate stats with the tournament performance data. 
It then builds a random forest model with the [ranger][4] package, using data from 2010 - 2018 to predict outcomes in 2019.

- The fifth script joins the ranked `ranger` predictions with the rankings from [kenpom.com](kenpom.com), and averages the two sets of scores to arrive at a final ranking. 

### About the Data

The data has three components:

- Season level stats, for NCAA teams from 1995 to 2019. This is scraped from sports-reference.com. Sadly there is a bias here, sports reference includes data from the post-season each year as well. So I limited the features in my model to only included percentage columns, not any with absolute quantities.

- Tournament-game data from 1995 to 2019. This is from [mmclaughlin87][1] github repository for the years 1995 to 2018. For 2017 and 2018, I dug further into the original source in [this pdf][2]. This data is the source of my dependent variable, which is the sum of the total winnings margin for each team for each year.

- The 2019 [kenpom.com ratings][3].
